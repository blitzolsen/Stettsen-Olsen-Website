            <img src="o1.png" height="15"> Subject: The color scheme of the entire page
            <br> Guideline:
            <a href="http://webstyleguide.com/wsg3/7-page-design/3-visual-design.html">Visual Design</a>
            <br> Guideline:
            <a href="http://webstyleguide.com/wsg3/8-typography/3-legibility.html">Legibility</a>
            <br> Rationale: Originally I planned on using two differnt .css
            <br> files in week 3. I worked an 80 hour week for the second week in a row and didn't
            <br> the directions very well due to lack of sleep. When I discovered that only one was to be
            <br> used I tried my best to tie the two already complete pages together. They didn't match
            <br> and some text was not easily read. That has been fixed.
            <br>
            <br>
            <img src="o1.png" height="15"> Subject: Page Structure
            <br> Guideline:
            <a href="http://webstyleguide.com/wsg3/6-page-structure/index.html">Page Structure</a>
            <br> Rationale: I went from a columner style to a linear style. The most important things are at
            <br> the top and then the content. Items devalue as you reach the end of the page. The quality of
            <br> page has been imporved as well. The header goes all the way across now. Elements have been
            <br> relatively placed so that as the page scales from wider to skinnier, elements will move and 
            <br> not obstruct the content.
            <br>

            <img src="o1.png" height="15"> Subject: Navigation and Wayfinding
            <br> Guideline:
            <a href="http://webstyleguide.com/wsg3/4-interface-design/2-navigation.html">Navigation and Wayfinding</a>
            <br> Rationale: Navigation has been improved is is now at the top of the screen. If this were a
            <br> larger website I would have full implemented breadcrum trails. I did to an extent.
            <br>

            <img src="o1.png" height="15"> Subject: Graphics
            <br> Guideline:
            <a href="http://webstyleguide.com/wsg3/11-graphics/index.html">Graphics</a>
            <br> Rationale: Graphics have been used in links, to seperate links, and to decorate
            <br> The page. The page wirefram and architecter have been improved. The header goes all
            <br> to the end.
            <br>
            <img src="o1.png" height="15"> Subject: Graphics
            <br> Guideline:
            <a href="http://webstyleguide.com/wsg2/type/space.html">White Space</a>
            <br> Rationale: White space as been used rather than boxes this gives the page more of
            <br> flow and less of a 1990's look. The page isn't chopped up. Lines have been used
            <br> in some parts of the page instead.
            <br>
            <br>
            <img src="o1.png" height="15"> I fixed the issues with last weeks project. Interactive elements have been added to the page.
            <br> I have been working some long weeks. I should be cutting back a little now. Sorry for the lack
            <br> of quality and thank you for your patience.
